DraggableSidebar Analysis:
- Sections already have drag & drop within blocks (SortableSection + SortableContext)
- Sections can be moved between blocks (onMoveSection)
- Sections can be reordered within blocks (onReorderSections)
- Tasks already have drag & drop within sections (SortableTask + SortableContext)
- Tasks can be moved between sections (onMoveTask)

What's MISSING:
1. Block drag & drop - blocks cannot be reordered
   - Need SortableBlock wrapper component
   - Need block IDs in SortableContext
   - Need onReorderBlocks callback prop
   - Need reorderBlocks backend procedure
   - Need drag handle on block headers
   - Need BlockDragOverlay component

2. Backend: Need reorderBlocks(projectId, blockIds) procedure

Current block rendering (line 592-712):
- blocks.map((block, index) => <div key={block.id}>...)
- Block header has no drag handle
- Need to wrap in SortableBlock component

Props to add:
- onReorderBlocks?: (projectId: number, blockIds: number[]) => void
