Team Slide Edit Mode - Key Findings (Feb 5, 2026)
==================================================

Current State:
- Successfully navigated to Slide 8 (Team: Опыт и Экспертиза)
- Clicked "Редактировать" (Edit) button to enter edit mode
- Edit mode is now active showing team member editing UI

UI Elements Visible:
1. Description textarea - contains team overview text
2. "Члены команды" (Team Members) label
3. "+ Добавить" (Add) button for adding new team members
4. Team member cards with:
   - Circular avatar placeholder (gray circle with user icon)
   - Name input field (currently showing bullet text like "**Основатели:** Опыт создания...")
   - Role/Position input field (placeholder: "Должность / Опыт")
   - Delete button (trash icon)
5. Cancel button ("Отмена")
6. Save button ("Сохранить изменения")

Photo Upload Feature:
- The avatar circles are clickable (based on code review)
- Clicking should trigger file input for photo upload
- Upload uses handlePhotoUpload() function
- Photos are uploaded via trpc.pitchDeck.uploadTeamPhoto mutation
- Uploaded photos stored in S3 and URL saved to team member

Issue Observed:
- Team member names are showing full bullet text instead of parsed names
- The parsing logic in handleStartEdit() should split "Name - Role" format
- Current bullets don't follow that format, so parsing may not work correctly

Next Steps:
1. Test clicking on avatar circle to trigger photo upload
2. Verify photo upload works correctly
3. Check if team member data is properly parsed/displayed
